Agith is a bot used for my private Discord bot. It was written using Atom and node.js.
The bot began with the following:

- node.js - Version 8.1.1
- discord.js API - Version 11.1.0
- Voice support with node-opus
- ffmpeg for voice channel support
- ytdl-core for streaming audio of online videos
	
Current functions:
- Purge
- Play a file from host's machine
- Stream one YT song at a time

TODO:
- Music queueing (YT API?)
- Access /r/dadjokes
- Text games
- Integrate clarifAI API (?)
